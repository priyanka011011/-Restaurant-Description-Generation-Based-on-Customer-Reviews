pongal both sweet and kara i can still feel the taste of the ghee bursting in my mouth but it was 'kaiholige' that made my day crisp and soft not to forget food is served on a banana leaf that adds in more flavor and taste waiters are attentive and responsive the customer's needs are monitored and addressed so much variety for just a a hrs without compromising on quantity and quality and yes it is
